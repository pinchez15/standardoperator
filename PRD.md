# Standard Operator - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

Standard Operator is an AI-powered SOP builder for small businesses. Users upload any content (documents, PDFs, emails, videos, audio, etc.), and the AI automatically drafts a structured SOP. Users can edit in-browser and export clean Word/PDF files. Unlike other tools, Standard Operator focuses on AI-first SOP creation rather than screen recording, making SOP writing painless.

## 2. Goals

- Remove the burden of SOP writing through AI
- Deliver a minimal, restrained UI (Notion/ChatGPT style)
- Allow exports in formats businesses actually use (Word/PDF)
- Offer optional "Arcade SOP" games for novelty and engagement

## 3. Users

**Primary**: Small business owners/managers who are lightly technical
- Know Microsoft and Google suites well
- Need to create/update SOPs for their organization
- Want simple, intuitive tools without complexity
- Single user per organization (not team collaboration)

**Secondary**: Consultants creating SOPs for clients

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1 Authentication
- Clerk for user auth + billing
- Freemium: 3 SOPs free, Pro at $20/mo

### 4.2 Library
- Left sidebar for folders/tags
- Stores all created SOPs
- Simple organization without complexity

### 4.3 Editor
- Center panel: Editable SOP (Notion-like rich text, via TipTap/Yjs)

- Simple conversation flow

### 4.5 Exports
- **Primary**: Word (editable) + PDF (clean)
- **Phase 2**: PowerPoint + public web page option
- Business-ready document formats

### 4.6 Arcade Mode (Manual at MVP)
Users see a "Play this SOP" button with options:
- **Space Invader style**: Resume-style demo
